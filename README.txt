Description:
This project involves developing a Python software system to automate a monorail shuttle that transports sand from a supply depot to a marble factory. The marble factory uses sand as a raw material to produce marbles. The project requires creating subclasses of an existing Shuttle class to implement different autopilot strategies.


Files:
-shuttle.py: Contains the Shuttle base class and where you will add your subclasses.
-fixtures.py: Contains the SupplyCache and DestinationCache classes. Do not modify this file.
-simulation.py: A sample program to simulate the shuttle system, useful for testing your code.
-tui.py: A module used by simulation.py for text-based user interface.
